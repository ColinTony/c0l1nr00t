## Introduction

In this post, I will explain how I set up my work environment to be as efficient as possible during my CTF and Bug Bounty sessions.

## The Operating System

I chose **Arch Linux** for its flexibility and because it allows me to better understand how my system works.

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
```

## Window Manager

I use **i3wm** to manage my windows. It is lightweight and highly configurable.

### Key Configuration

1.  Keyboard shortcuts for terminals.
2.  Dedicated workspaces for tools.

## Conclusion

Having a comfortable environment is key to productivity.
